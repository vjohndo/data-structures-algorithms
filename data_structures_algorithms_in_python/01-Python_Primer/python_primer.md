## Python is an interpreted language

## Objects in Python
* An assignment statement is something like:
    * my_variable = 120.5

* my_variable is the *identifier*
* 120.5 is the object associated, in this case, a floating point 
* an *alias* is another identifier for an object. Reassignment may break the alias
* evaluating an expression like 98 + 8.0 instantiates a new float object
* *instantiation* invokes the *constructor* of a class
* temp = 98.6 creates an instance of the float class. This expression is known as a literal form.
