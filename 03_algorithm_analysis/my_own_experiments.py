# Devise an experiement to verify that the list index operator is O(1)

# Devise an experiment to verify that get itm and set item are O(1) for dictionaries

# Devise an experiement that compares the performance of the del operator on lists and dictionaries

# Given a list of number in random order write and algorithm that works in O(nlog(n)) to kind the kth smallest num

# Can you imporve the algorithm form the proveious prblem to be linear? Explain....
